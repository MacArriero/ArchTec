<p align="left">
    ArchiTech is concept to display 3D rendered building/house models on the web.
    It uses a combination of the ThreeJS library with Greensock scroll trigger to navigate across
    different 3D models. It can be used for displaying architectural designs to potential clients
    over the web, adding another dimension to the traditional sketch designs.
